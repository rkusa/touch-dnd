**Status:** Tested with current version of Chrome (Mac & Android), Safari (Mac & iOS), Opera Next, Firefox and IE  
**Documentation:** [ma.rkusa.st/touch-dnd](http://ma.rkusa.st/touch-dnd)

#### Why?

This library is a derivative of [zepto-dnd](https://github.com/rkusa/zepto-dnd), which reached the limits of the native HTML5 Drag'n'Drop API, especially in terms of dragging helper accessibility and - most important - in terms of compatiblity with touch devices.

#### Features

* Draggable, Droppable & Sortable
* **touch compatibility**
* utilizes CSS3 [`transform`](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp) and [`transition`](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) property for moving draggables around
* [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/) compatibility
